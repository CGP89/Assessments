# Assessments

Preferred IDE: IntelliJ idea
To run test:
Open the project in IDE, go to Tests> UltimateQA_Forms_Test > right-click and click Run UltimateQA_Forms_Test

The test navigates to Ultimate QA's form page and enters information into the name and message input boxes. Once Submit is clicked a message will show. 
The test validates that the message displays correctly. Information is retrieved from a properties file in the properties directory. 
Name and message information can be changed to validate different data.

The Automation test application uses testNG to validate tests.
